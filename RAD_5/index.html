        <h2>RAD5 Tech Hub: My journey so far</h2>


        <p> My name is Atuorah Obinna. I'm an aspiring frontend developer.
        I have been learning how to code on my own for some time using resources from 
        the web, like w3school, freeCodeCamp, etc. In the beginning, it was fun but at a 
        point, i got stocked, and that's when i knew i needed someone to mentor me. 
        I started looking for a bootcamp that I can attend.</p>

        <p> I searched the web, and some centers showed up, so I proceeded to visit some 
        locations. After the visitations, one of the centers stood out - RAD5 Tech Hub. 
        so i went ahead to register with them.</p>

        <p> My first day at RAD5 Tech Hub went fine, nothing unexpected happened. 
        There were a few young guys already seated when i came in.
        I greeted them and have my seat. One of the RAD5 team members came to 
        introduce himself to us as Mr Chinecherem and made us introduce ourselves 
        by our firstname after we had our opening prayer. We had two girls among us 
        and coincidentally, they bear the-same name - Chioma. So we differentiated 
        them with "chioma with glasses" and "chioma without glasses".
        We were told that more people will be joining us by the next class. 
        Thanks to the Humans of the RAD5 scholarship program.</p>

        <p> We were later introduce to Mr Nnanna John and Mr Igwe Uguru who happens to 
        be the founders of the company. They took their turns to tell us about the 
        program, what to expect and how to survive. An alumnus of the program who 
        happens to be around also told us about his experience both during the 
        bootcamp and after the bootcamp and what to expect after the program. 
        Everything they said boils down to determination an being committed to our 
        studies. It was an interesting speech altogether and we later called it a day.</p>

        <p> The second class was filled-up as expected. More people join us from the 
        scholarship program. Mr Nnanna took us on an introduction to computer science 
        and web development. He taught us about three types of people in tech, people 
        with the information, people with the skills, and people with both information 
        and skills. We also learnt about conversion of bits to byte (8 bits = 1 byte), 
        byte to kilobyte (1000 bytes = 1 kilobyte),and kilobyte to megabyte (1000 kilobytes 
        = 1 megabyte). We also learnt about Bandwidth (maximum transmission capacity 
        of a device) and Latency (the amount of time it takes a bit to travel from the 
        source to the requesting device).</p>

        <p> We also learnt about DNS (Domain Server Name), HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), 
        and HTTP Verbs(Get, Post, Put, Delete). We were asked to open an account with 
        Medium.com, check out Grammarly and follow the Google developer group and Devcircle on 
        social media. We were also asked to read about Chat AI.</p>

        <p> So far, it has been a wonderful experience and I look forward to an amazing 
        and life-changing time with RAD5 Tech Hub.</p>
        
        <p> Thanks for Reading.</p>
